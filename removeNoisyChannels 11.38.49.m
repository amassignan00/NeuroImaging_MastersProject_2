% The output is a column vector with 0 for channels to be removed and 1 for channels to be kept.

% Since no information about the signal range is provided, we modified the
% removeNoisyChannels function to accept dRange as an optional argument. If
% dRange is not present, then dRange is set as [-Inf, Inf]. This has been done because we
% may decide to set a range.

% NB: the order of the inputs has changed! SNRrange must come before dRange

% Compute mean of each channel and SNR

% Find channels within dRange and > SNR
remCh = zeros(size(nirsData,2),1);
